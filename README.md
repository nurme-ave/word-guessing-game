## Overview

### Project Description

My idea for this project was inspired by my birthday gift to my awesome little niece. I built her her very own interactive word guessing game website in Estonian for her 6th birthday. I decided to extend the idea and create a similar site in English, also for children.

Since this was my very first JavaScript project which I wrote from scratch without following any tutorials I refactored it a few months later after learning new skills.

Changes made:
- split the main JS file into smaller JS files (modular JS)
- generated the alphabet with String.fromCharCode()
- displayed the letters & created categories dynamically with map()
- utilized Event Delegation to listen for events on multiple elements
- added a favicon
