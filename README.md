## Overview

### Project Description

My idea for this project was inspired by my birthday gift to my awesome little niece. I built her her very own interactive word guessing game website in Estonian for her 6th birthday. I decided to extend the idea and create a similar site in English, also for children. No CSS frameworks are used here and I implemented the design and the layout myself.

This is by far my most favorite project I have ever worked on and I was driven by so much passion writing the code. It was my very first JavaScript project which I wrote from scratch without following any tutorials. I plan to refactor the code some time soon since I've learned new skills which will definitely become handy here.

With this project I learned how to build the game logic through different functions. I also got quite good practice with manipulating the DOM.

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.

UPDATE: This code was refactored on April 15th, 2022.

Changes made:
- split the main JavaSript file into smaller JS files
- generated the alphabet with String.fromCharCode()
- displayed the letters & created categories dynamically with map()
- utilized Event Delegation to listen for events on multiple elements
